# VOS WASH: Android APK Build Process Overview

This document outlines the main phases for packaging the VOS WASH web application into a native Android APK. For a detailed, step-by-step guide, please refer to the instructions provided in the chat.

## Phase 1: Prepare the Web App

Create an optimized, static build of the React application. This bundles all necessary code and assets into a `dist` folder, making it ready for integration into the Android project.

## Phase 2: Set Up the Android Project

Create a new, empty Android Studio project that will serve as the native shell for the web app. This involves setting up the project structure, name, and minimum required Android version (SDK).

## Phase 3: Integrate Web App and Implement Native Bridge

Copy the built web assets into the Android project. Configure the project's layout to use a WebView and update the `MainActivity.kt` file to load the web app. This phase also includes implementing a critical JavaScript-to-native bridge, which allows the web app to trigger native Android functions, such as the single-tap PDF sharing feature for WhatsApp.

## Phase 4: Build and Generate the Signed APK

Perform final configurations like setting the app icon and theme. Then, build and test the application on an emulator or physical device. Once testing is complete, generate a signed, release-ready APK file that can be installed on Android devices.
